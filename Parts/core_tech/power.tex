%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Power Cells}
The most popular and common power cells in the universe are those produced by Andromeda Electric using Susanoo's storm in the Andromeda Galaxy. While there are non-AE power cells, they are uncommon.

There are several sizes of power cell, designated by letter from AA (the smallest) to F (the largest). Power cells increase in power exponentially. An A cell is 10 times as powerful as an AA cell, a B cell has 10 tomes the power of an A cell, and so on.

\textit{AA cell:} These tiny cells operate devices which need minimal power. \$1, 0.0005 lb. \label{itm:aa_cell}

\textit{A cell:} The size of a watch battery, or postage stamp-sized for flexible cells (see below). \$2, 0.005 lb. \label{itm:a_cell}

\textit{B cell:} The size of a pistol cartridge or 21st century AA battery. \$3, 0.05 lb. \label{itm:b_cell}

\textit{C cell:} The most common type of power cell. Most equipment designed for larger or smaller cells often include an adapter for C-cell operation. Each cell is about the same size as a pistol magazine. \$10, 0.5 lb. \label{itm:c_cell}

\textit{D cell:} Often worn as a power pack, they're about the size of a thick paperback book. \$100, 5 lb. LC4. \label{itm:d_cell}

\textit{E cell:} About the size of a backpack. \$2,000, 20 lb. LC4. \label{itm:e_cell}

\textit{F cell:} About the size of a compact car engine. \$20,000, 200 lb. LC4. \label{itm:f_cell}

\subsubsection{Flexible Cells}
Andromeda Electric also sells flexible variants of their power cells. They are attached like stamps and peeled off when exhausted. Gadgets noted as using flexible cells use them \textit{instead} of normal power cells; they're also embedded into smart labels, smart paper, and similar disposable items. AA and A cost the same but larger sizes are 4 times the normal cost.

\subsubsection{Non-Rechargeable Power Cells}

Normal cells and flexible cells are rechargeable, but there are also non-rechargeable cells. They last twice as as long (or provide twice as many shots) but may not be recharged. They are otherwise identical.

%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Replacing Power Cells}
\subsection{Replacing Power Cells}
It takes three seconds to replace an A, B, or C cells with a new one, or 5 seconds to replace a tiny AA or heft D or E cell, or 20 seconds to replace an F cell. Cells can only be replaced if the user is strong enough to light them out.

Fast-Draw (Ammo) skill can be used to reduce the time for cells loaded into weapons. A successful skill roll reduces the replacement time by one second.

\subsection{Exploding Power Cells}
AE Power Cells contain the volatile energy of Susanoo's storm. As a result, they can explode if destroyed. When they explode, they act as an explosive of the same weight as the cell with REF of 2. The explosion does crushing explosion surge damage.

%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Jury-Rigging Power cells}
\subsection{Jury-Rigging Power cells}
Even though devices are designed for a specific size of cell, different cells can be jury-rigged to work. Ten cells that are one size category smaller can substitute for a single larger cell. This requires a roll against Electrician-2 and 10 minutes of work per attemt; critical failure damages the gadget.

Given the prevalence of AE's cells, their design has become the standard and even other company's cells will work in products designed for them. The exception to this is when dealing with older cells. Rolls to use them are at an additional penalty which varies based off the age of the cell.

\textit{Semi~-Portable Fission Reactor:} A small fission reactor that fits in a truck bed. \$100,000, 1,000 lb. Typically provides external power for 5 years before refueling and maintenance; Refueling and maintenance is \$50,000. LC2. \label{itm:sp_fission_react}

\subsubsection{Solar Power Array}
Semi-portable array of solar panels that provides external power. It takes a minute to deploy and covers about 400 square feet. \$10,000, 500 lb. These sizes are based on earth-like levels of sunlight; multiply cost and weight by relative light levels for other environments. LC4 \label{itm:solar_array}

Cheap plastic solar cells that can be painted onto any surface, including clothing or rooftops. A coating of solar paint is only 20\% of the cost and weight of regular solar panels, but requires twice the surface area and has no DR. LC4 \label{itm:solar_paint}

%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Beamed and Broadcast Power}
\section{Beamed and Broadcast Power}\label{sec:beamed_broadcast_power}
Devices may operate on beamed or broadcast power coming from a central station. Generally, they must remain within line of sight. This is commonplace in the Andromeda Galaxy as AE has set up widespread infrastructure. Other planets may have something similar set up as well.

If needed, the cost of this power per month is generally equal to 1\% the cost of a customer's power receivers

%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Beamed Power}
\subsection{Beamed Power}\label{subsec:beamed_power}
Constructed like power cells, these weight the same as the normal power cell they are replacing. They operate indefinitely as long as it is in the line of sight of the transmitter. If sight is interrupted, the receiver's backup system provides power for 1/10th as long as the normal power cell. Cost is the same, but only D cells or larger are available. Beamed power transmitters are usually 10 times the cost and double the weight of an equivalent power cell per mile or fraction of a mile of range; they power one system at a time.

%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Broadcast Power}
\subsection{Broadcast Power}\label{subsec:broadcast_power}
This relatively recent innovation from Andromeda Electric works similarly to beamed power, but does not require line of sight for transmission. Broadcast receivers are 10 times as expensive as normal power cells and can come in any size, not just D and up. Broadcast power transmitters are generally double the cost and weight of an equivalent power cell per yard of radius.
