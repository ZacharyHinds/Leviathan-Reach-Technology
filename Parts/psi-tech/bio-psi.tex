% TODO: Write the limitations of psi-drugs

\subsection{Blocker}\label{subsec:blocker_psi-drug}
This drug temporarily increases the recipient’s natural telepathic resistance, making him less vulnerable to mental intrusion. The user gains Resistant to Telepathy (+3) for six hours, but must roll vs. HT to avoid a headache (treat as moderate pain, p. B428) for the duration. A telepath resists the headache at -3, and gains the defensive benefit at the cost of -3 to \textit{his} rolls against Telepathy skills. Hypo form only. \$100/dose. LC4.

\subsection{Blue Fire}\label{subsec:blue_fire_psi-drug}
This is the nickname of a dangerous neurotransmitter that enhances the brain’s ability to handle psionic energy. It’s also a deadly poison! Fortunately, its effects are relatively predictable and an antidote exists; thus, many psis are willing to risk taking it when a boost is absolutely necessary.

As soon as a dose of Blue Fire takes effect, the user suffers 2 HP of injury and gains +2 to every psi Talent he possesses. He loses an additional 1d-2 HP (minimum 1 HP) per minute until the drug is counteracted by an antitoxin. Blue Fire \textit{will} eventually kill him if it isn’t neutralized. Multiple doses have no extra effect.

A psi under the influence of Blue Fire must make a Will roll at -1 immediately after his first active use of psi (that is, after rolling against a psi skill) and again each minute after that until the drug is neutralized. Failure means he may stop rolling but gains the disadvantage Overconfidence (9), also until the Blue Fire is counteracted. Someone who becomes overconfident will enjoy the sensational high of using his psi abilities and tend to ignore the fact that the drug is eating away at his body.

Neutralizing Blue Fire requires a simple injection of Neurovine, an antidote for nerve toxins (\$30/dose, hypo form only). However, a user who has become overconfident due to Blue Fire’s effects must make a Will roll at -1 to convince himself to administer the Neurovine. If he fails, he may roll again every minute.

Blue Fire is available in hypo, inhaler, and pill form. A hypo takes effect instantly, an inhaled dose requires five seconds, and a pill takes 30 seconds. Effects last until neutralized. \$20/dose. LC2.

\subsection{Brainstorm}\label{subsec:brainstorm}
This powerful drug makes it much easier for the user to enhance psi abilities through extra effort (\textbf{GURPS Psionic Powers}, p. 7): Reduce the penalty to his extra-effort rolls from -1 per +10\% increase to -1 per +20\%. Make a HT roll determine duration, which is 10 minutes times margin of success but always at least 10 minutes. Multiple doses have no additional effect.

Brainstorm’s benefits come at a potentially severe price, however! First, any critical failure with a boosted ability automatically cripples it rather than requiring a Will roll to avoid crippling. The GM will roll on the table under \textit{Optional Crippling} Rules (\textbf{Psionic Powers}, p. 7) instead.

Moreover, the rush of power is \textit{addictive}. Anyone who exploits Brainstorm to boost an ability has to roll vs. HT to avoid addiction. Failure means that he must have at least one dose every day. Otherwise, he suffers the effects of withdrawal from a physiological dependency (p. B440) and one of his psi abilities acquires the Uncontrollable limitation (unless this was already the case) for the duration of his addiction.

Hypo form only. Takes effect in two seconds. \$150/dose. LC3.
