\section{Psi-Drugs}

\subsection{Blocker}\label{subsec:blocker_psi-drug}
This drug temporarily increases the recipient's natural telepathic resistance, making him less vulnerable to mental intrusion. The user gains Resistant to Telepathy (+3) for six hours, but must roll vs. HT to avoid a headache (treat as moderate pain, p. B428) for the duration. A telepath resists the headache at -3, and gains the defensive benefit at the cost of -3 to \textit{his} rolls against Telepathy skills. Hypo form only. \$100/dose. LC4.

\subsection{Blue Fire}\label{subsec:blue_fire_psi-drug}
This is the nickname of a dangerous neurotransmitter that enhances the brain's ability to handle psionic energy. It's also a deadly poison! Fortunately, its effects are relatively predictable and an antidote exists; thus, many psis are willing to risk taking it when a boost is absolutely necessary.

As soon as a dose of Blue Fire takes effect, the user suffers 2 HP of injury and gains +2 to every psi Talent he possesses. He loses an additional 1d-2 HP (minimum 1 HP) per minute until the drug is counteracted by an antitoxin. Blue Fire \textit{will} eventually kill him if it isn't neutralized. Multiple doses have no extra effect.

A psi under the influence of Blue Fire must make a Will roll at -1 immediately after his first active use of psi (that is, after rolling against a psi skill) and again each minute after that until the drug is neutralized. Failure means he may stop rolling but gains the disadvantage Overconfidence (9), also until the Blue Fire is counteracted. Someone who becomes overconfident will enjoy the sensational high of using his psi abilities and tend to ignore the fact that the drug is eating away at his body.

Neutralizing Blue Fire requires a simple injection of Neurovine, an antidote for nerve toxins (\$30/dose, hypo form only). However, a user who has become overconfident due to Blue Fire's effects must make a Will roll at -1 to convince himself to administer the Neurovine. If he fails, he may roll again every minute.

Blue Fire is available in hypo, inhaler, and pill form. A hypo takes effect instantly, an inhaled dose requires five seconds, and a pill takes 30 seconds. Effects last until neutralized. \$20/dose. LC2.

\subsection{Brainstorm}\label{subsec:brainstorm}
This powerful drug makes it much easier for the user to enhance psi abilities through extra effort (\textbf{GURPS Psionic Powers}, p. 7): Reduce the penalty to his extra-effort rolls from -1 per +10\% increase to -1 per +20\%. Make a HT roll determine duration, which is 10 minutes times margin of success but always at least 10 minutes. Multiple doses have no additional effect.

Brainstorm's benefits come at a potentially severe price, however! First, any critical failure with a boosted ability automatically cripples it rather than requiring a Will roll to avoid crippling. The GM will roll on the table under \textit{Optional Crippling} Rules (\textbf{Psionic Powers}, p. 7) instead.

Moreover, the rush of power is \textit{addictive}. Anyone who exploits Brainstorm to boost an ability has to roll vs. HT to avoid addiction. Failure means that he must have at least one dose every day. Otherwise, he suffers the effects of withdrawal from a physiological dependency (p. B440) and one of his psi abilities acquires the Uncontrollable limitation (unless this was already the case) for the duration of his addiction.

Hypo form only. Takes effect in two seconds. \$150/dose. LC3.

\subsection{Catalyst Drug}\label{subsec:catalyst_drug}
This is a massive dose of psi-boosting drug combined with a specialized psychotropic agent. Anyone who takes it must roll vs. HT-3. Success means no effect. Failure results in 2d hours of unconsciousness, during which the victim experiences bizarre, often terrifying hallucinations; treat this as a Fright Check on awakening, at -1 per hour spent unconscious. Unless the user is a latent esper -- that is, someone with Talent but no abilities -- there's no further effect.

If the recipient \textit{is} a latent psi, however, he may manifest psi abilities paid for with unspent points, bypassing any normal limitations on such purchases in the campaign. The user may take new mental disadvantages -- in addition to anything the Fright Check inflicts -- and spend the associated points on more psi capabilities. In all cases, abilities gained this way often match the drug-induced visions; e.g., a nightmare of burning could catalyze Pyrokinesis.

These drugs are strictly controlled. Available as a hypo (takes effect in 30 seconds), inhaled form (takes a minute), and pill form (takes five minutes). \$3,000/dose. LC1.

\subsection{Mind Hype}\label{subsec:mind_hype}
A reliable psi-boosting drug, Mind Hype focuses the user on his inner self, dissolving the boundaries between body and mind. He gets +1 to IQ, raising Will, Per, and \textit{all} skills based on IQ, Wil, or Per. \textit{Psi} skills are at +3 instead of merely +1. To determine the duration of  these bonuses, make an HT roll; benefits last for 10 minutes per point of success, but always at least an hour. More than one dose has no noticeable effect.

However, each dose taken requires an IQ roll, at -1 per dose past the first in a 24-hour period. Failure means the user has difficulty concentrating on less-abstract things -- e.g., walking across a room. He has -2 to DX and all DX-based skills. Moreover, for anything not having to do with psionics or with abstract reasoning, he suffers Absent-Mindedness (p. B122). If he already has this disadvantage, he makes all rolls to remember trivial things or sustain interest in boring activities at an additional -3! These side effects last for 1d hours.

Mind Hype isn't addictive. Only available in a hypo form. Takes effect in 10 minutes. \$100/dose. LC3.

\subsection{Muffler}\label{subsec:muffler}
This drug works to shut down all of the subject's psionic neural pathways. He must roll vs. HT-4 on being injected. Failure means that he cannot exercise \textit{any} psi powers for (25 - HT)/4 hours, minimum one hour. Hypo form only. \$800/dose. LC2.

\subsection{Psi-Boosters}\label{subsec:psi-booster}
Psi-boosters are a \textit{series} of designer pharmaceuticals which are engineered to induce a specific psi ability; e.g., psi-booster (Telereceive). A psi-booster has no effect on a user lacks the underlying power (such as Telepathy for Telereceive). If he has that power, he gains the ability in question -- at level 1, for a gift with more than one level. If he already possess the specific ability, he gets a 50\% increase in level (per the effect of extra effort), rounded down, if it comes in levels, or a free +50\% enhancement if it doesn't. In all cases, duration is HT/2 minutes.

Psi-boosters are reasonably safe when taken in moderation. The only side effect of a single dose is that the strain reduces the user's Talent for the power associated with the ability gained or boosted, lowering it by a level for a day afterward. Minimum Talent is 0.

However, taking two or more doses of the same psi-booster inside of eight hours is dangerous! An additional dose within that period provides no extra enhancement beyond extending duration if the drug is still active, and requires a HT-4 roll (HT-8, if the drug's effects are still active). Failure inflicts 1d HP of injury times the margin, in the form of a brain hemorrhage. This high risk of potentially fatal complications means that a psi-booster can be used as a deadly -- if costly -- poison by delivering two doses or transmitting a second dose to a dosed victim.

Psi-boosters are available in hypo and inhaler form; either takes effect immediately. Cost per dose is \$100 times the point cost of the ability provided. For an ability that comes in multiple levels, use the cost of the first level. LC2

\subsection{Shatter}\label{subsec:shatter}
Anyone with any psionic power -- even a latent -- who uses this drug becomes tipsy (p. B428). This affliction lasts for minutes equal to the total point value of his psionic Talents and abilities. After that, he may roll vs. HT every minute. Success means the drug wears off.

Using psionic powers while under the influence of Shatter risks worsening its effects to severe vertigo and nausea. After attempting any psi skill roll, the user must make an immediately HT-3 roll to avoid becoming nauseated \textit{and} drunk (p. B428) for minutes equal to the margin of failure. Multiple doses of Shatter increase the effects' duration but not their severity. Too much of it is toxic, however. Each dose past the first in a 24-hour period inflicts 1d-3 points of toxic damage (minimum 1) on the psi.

Individuals without psi powers suffer \textit{none} of these effects. Because of this, Shatter can be used to ``test'' for psionics. A psi who's affected by it must make a Will-2 roll to avoid reacting visibly (showing signs of dizziness, sweating, etc.), even if he doesn't use his powers. Law-enforcement agencies more typically use Shatter to restrain \textit{known} psis.

Available forms are hypo (can be delivered by darts shot from any weapon capable of firing drugged rounds), gas (in spray cans or any of the biochemical aerosol warheads on p. \pageref{subsec:biochemical_aerosol}), and pill. Hypo form works instantly; gas or pill form takes effect in 10 seconds. \$20/dose. LC2.

\subsection{Trance}\label{subsec:trance}
The opposite of drugs like Blocker (p. \pageref{subsec:blocker_psi-drug}), this drug \textit{lowers} the user's natural psi resistance. This makes Trance useful to telepathic psychologists -- and interrogators. As it can render subjects more susceptible to mental control, it may gain a sinister reputation. Paranoid people might fear that groups employing psis are putting it in the water supply!

Each dose of Trance gives the subject -2 to Will to resist Telepathy abilities. Up to three doses are cumulative, but this can be dangerous. After taking each dose, the user must make a HT+3 roll, at -1 per dose past the first. Failure means he lapses into a coma (p. B429) \textit{and} suffers HP of injury equal to his margin of failure.

Trance is available in pill and hypo form. Either takes effect in 10 seconds and lasts six hours, regardless of dosage. \$15/dose. LC3.

\subsection{Window}\label{subsec:window_psi-drug}
Given to someone with the Telepathy power, this drug enhances his gifts, granting +2 to Telepathy Talent. However, it also dissolves his normal psychic barriers, giving him the Supersensitive disadvantage (p. B158) \textit{and} completely suppressing any psionic Mind Shield advantage (p. B70) he may possess. Psis who take it unwillingly may roll vs. HT-3 to resist. The effects last for (25 - HT)/4 hours, minimum one hour.

Window is available in hypo, inhaler, and pill form. \$250/dose. LC2.
